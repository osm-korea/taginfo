            intro:
                <p>OpenStreetMap uses <b>tags</b> of the form <b>key=value</b>
                to add meaning to geographic objects. Taginfo collects information
                about these tags from several sources to help you understand what
                they mean and how they are used.</p>

            text: |
                <p>OpenStreetMap uses <b>tags</b> to add meaning to geographic objects. There
                is no fixed list of those tags. New tags can be invented and used as needed.
                Everybody can come up with a new tag and add it to new or existing objects.
                This makes OpenStreetMap enormously flexible, but sometimes also a bit hard
                to work with.</p>
                <p>Whether you are contributing to OSM or using the OSM data, there are always
                questions like: What tags do people use for feature X? What tags can I use
                for feature Y so that it appears properly on the map? Is the tag Z described
                on the wiki actually in use and where?</p>
                <p>Taginfo helps you by showing statistics about which tags are actually in the
                database, how many people use those tags, where they are used and so on. It
                also gets information about tags from the wiki and from other places. Taginfo
                tries to bring together all information about tags to help you understand
                how they are used and what they mean. See a <a href="sources">list of sources</a>

        intro: |
            Any valid Unicode character can appear in an OSM key but usually
            only lower case latin letters (a-z) and the underscore (_) are
            used. The colon (:) is often used as a separator character. This
            report categorizes all keys according to the characters they use.

            characters: Characters in key
            characters_in_keys:
                plain: Only latin lowercase letters (<span class="char">a</span> to <span class="char">z</span>) and underscore (<span class="char">_</span>), first and last characters are letters.
                colon: Like A but with one or more colons (<span class="char">:</span>) inside.
                letters: Like B but with uppercase latin letters or letters from other alphabets.
                space: At least one whitespace character (space, tab, new line, carriage return, or from other alphabets).
                problem: Contains possibly problematic characters <span class="char">=+/&amp;&lt;&gt;;'"?%#@\,</span>.
                rest: Everything else.

                <p>Keys containing only lowercase latin letters (<span
                class="char">a</span> to <span class="char">z</span>) and the
                underscore (<span class="char">_</span>). First and last
                characters must be letters. Most simple keys should fall into
                this category.</p>
        colon:
            tab: Colon
            title: Keys with colon

                class="char">:</span>) characters inside in addition to the
                letters (<span class="char">a</span> to <span
                class="char">z</span>) and underscores (<span
                class="char">_</span>). The colon is often used as a hierarchy
                separator character.</p>
        letters:
            tab: Letters
            title: Keys with uppercase letters or letters from other scripts
            intro: |
                <p>Lowercase letters from the latin script are usually
                preferred for keys, but sometimes uppercase letters are used
                (for instance for known abbreviations) or letters from other
                scripts (for instance for keys only relevant to an area where
                that script is used predominantly).</p>
        space:
            tab: Whitespace
            title: Keys with whitespace
            intro: |
                <p>Keys that contain whitespace characters such as space, tab,
                new line, carriage return, or whitespace characters from other
                alphabets. Whitespace in keys can be confusing, especially at
                the beginning or end of the key, because they are invisible.
                Generally the whitespace should be removed or the underscore
                (<span class="char">_</span>) used instead.</p>
        problem:
            tab: Problematic
            title: Keys with possibly problematic characters
            intro: |
                <p>Keys that contain possibly problematic characters: <span
                class="char">=+/&amp;&lt;&gt;;'"?%#@\,</span> or control
                characters. These characters can be problematic, because they
                are used to quote strings in different programming languages or
                have special meanings in XML, HTML, URLs, and other places. The
                equal sign is used often as separator between tag keys and
                values. Keys that appear in this list are not necessarily wrong
                though. But in many cases they are just results of some error
                and should be fixed.</p>

            of these keys, please create the wiki page by clicking on the link in the

            OpenStreetMap is an international project. Tags and their descriptions can

        intro: |
            This table shows keys for which a wiki page exists but there is not a single
            instance in the database. This is not necessarily an error (maybe somebody
            added the documentation in the wiki as preparation for using a key or the wiki
            page documents a now obsolete key), but it can also be a typo or other error.

        name: Similar keys
        intro: |
            This report shows keys used very often and similar keys used very
            rarely. This exposes many misspellings of common keys, but is not
            perfect. Take care when fixing the data! Do NOT just mechanically
            edit those keys with search-and-replace. Look at each case individually
            and also fix other problems that you see.

            variant is better. But sometimes it makes sense to have different
            images because of different cultural backgrounds or so.

        intro: |
            Taginfo reads all wiki pages used to describe keys, tags, and
            relations to find information about tags. This report shows a list
            of problems encountered while reading those pages. These aren't
            necessarily errors in the wiki, they just mean that something in
            the wiki pages isn't formatted in a way taginfo understands. Either
            the page has to be corrected or taginfo has to be fixed.
